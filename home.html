I am the oldest of 5 bad kids. I only have one full blood sister her name is Adriana Elaine Mata. We have the same mom and dad,but our dad really isn't in the picture. See when we were younger my mom met my step dad, Raul Zamora, and he has raised us like his own kids. When I was 10 years old my mom started having kids again.Now I have one brother named Zachary Ozzy Zamora, and two other sisters named Carizma Nevaeh Zamora and Zoey Izzabel Zamora.</p>
