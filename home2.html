<p style="color:#ffffff; float: left; width:500px">My mom is the most wonderful person I know. She has always been there for me when I needed her the most. She is bearly taller than me. Even though she left for a while she was always with me in my heart. My mom loves to do makeup. She went to ogle community college to get her degree in estitistics. By her doing that she inspired me to go to college and get a degree in what I love.  I love her unconditionaly and I always will.  </p>
